# Build Instructions for RustyDB

## Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Follow the on-screen instructions and restart your terminal
```

## Building the Project

Once Rust is installed, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/filipposnikolopoulos/Projects/SQLDatabaseRust

# Build the project in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run the database
cargo run --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run examples
cargo run --example basic_usage
cargo run --example sharding_demo
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Interactive mode
cargo run --release

# Single command execution
cargo run --release -- -e "SELECT * FROM users"

# Sharded mode with 4 shards
cargo run --release -- --shards 4

# Get help
cargo run --release -- --help
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get "cargo: command not found", make sure:
1. You've installed Rust from https://rustup.rs
2. You've restarted your terminal after installation
3. Run: `source $HOME/.cargo/env`

## All Warnings and Errors Fixed

The following issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Fixed unused imports
- ✅ Fixed `Value::Eq` trait implementation (Float now uses i64 internally)
- ✅ Fixed `Assignment.id` field (now uses `Assignment.target`)
- ✅ Fixed `ColumnOption::Unique` pattern matching
- ✅ Fixed mutable borrow in sharding scatter-gather
- ✅ All warnings removed
